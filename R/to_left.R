# Get first edge in clockwise direction from this_edge. The edges don't need to
# be sorted, rather each pair of neighbouring edges are subjected to a binary
# comparison, recording the first clockwise edge of each. Any edges which are
# not the first clockwise edge in any comparison must be excluded, and the
# vector of all such edges will then include all values except the desired one.
# Calculations are based on vector determinants:
